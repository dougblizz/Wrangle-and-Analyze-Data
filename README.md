# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
In this project, I'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This data will include retweet count and favorite count. Before I can run my API querying code, I need to set up my own Twitter application. Once I have this set up, I will develop some code to create an API object that I'll use to gather Twitter data. After querying each tweet ID, I will write its JSON data to a tweet_json.txt file with each tweet's JSON data on its own line. I will then read this file, line by line, to create a pandas DataFrame that I will assess and clean.
